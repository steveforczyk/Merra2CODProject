# Merra2CODProject
Code used to Extract and Process Cloud Optical Depth Data from Merra2 Program Data Storage
## MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO)
using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4. The purpose of this program is to gather data from a wide variety of sources to
further atmospheric modelling efforts. This project has been running since 1980.Merra2 means that this is the second iteration of the project. The overall proces is 
called data assimilation. In practical terms this indicates gathering data from a wide variety of sensors (space based,atmospheric balloons and aircraft as well as 
land and sea based sensors.
The contributing sensors have a wide variety of capabilities,sampling rates,wavelength regimes etc. The assimilation process is meant to combine these disparate results
and agglomorate this data to estimate and the values of measured producrs on a common data grid. In the case of Merra2 this data grid is spaced at 0.5 deg in latitude and
0.625 deg in longitude. This produces a grid of diemnsions 576 x 361 points.
